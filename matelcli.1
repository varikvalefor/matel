.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm matelcli
performs various Matrix-related tasks via a command-line
interface, as opposed to the terminal user interface of
.Xr matel 1 .
.Pp
The benefits of this user interface include but are not limited to
scriptability, intuitiveness, and a decent number of Easter eggs.
Additionally,
.Nm matelcli
can theoretically be accessed from teletypewriters, which is cool.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The details of the configuration file are described in
.Xr matel 1 .
.Sh LISTING STUFF
.Nm matelcli list
.Op rooms | communities | spaces
.Pp
The
.Nm list
command lists various Matrix entities.
.Pp
.Nm matelcli list rooms
lists the Matrix rooms of which the user of
.Nm matelcli
is a member.
.Pp
.Nm matelcli list communities
lists the Matrix communities of which the user of
.Nm matelcli
is a member.
.Pp
.Nm matelcli list spaces
lists the Matrix spaces of which the user of
.Nm matelcli
is a member.
.Sh SENDING MESSAGES
.Ss SENDING TEXT
.Nm matelcli send text
.Ar room
sends the text which is fetched from the standard input to the Matrix
room whose internal Matrix ID is
.Ar room .
.Pp
One advantage of using this standard input-based approach is being able
to send the contents of suitably short files as text-based messages.
Assuming that
.Pa methage
contains printable text and
.Ar dummies
is a valid internal Matrix room ID, a command which sends the content of
.Pa methage
to Matrix room
.Ar dummies
is as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
matelcli send text dummies < methage
.Ed
.Pp
Additionally, using the standard input-based approach facilitates
including arbitrary characters in the bodies of messages.
.Ss SENDING FILES
.Nm matelcli send file
.Ar path
.Ar room
sends the file whose path is
.Ar path
to the Matrix room whose internal Matrix ID is
.Ar room .
.Ss SENDING NOTICES
.Nm matelcli send notice
.Ar room
sends a
.Dq m.notice
event whose
.Dq body
content equals the standard input to the Matrix room whose internal
Matrix room ID is
.Ar room .
.Ss SENDING LOCATIONS
.Nm matelcli send location
.Ar geouri
.Ar room
sends a
.Dq m.location
message whose
.Dq geo_uri
field contains
.Ar geouri
to the Matrix room whose internal Matrix ID is
.Ar room .
The
.Dq body
field of this message is fetched from the standard input.
.Sh GRABBING PILLS, IF "PILLS" REFERS TO MESSAGES
.Nm matelcli grab
.Ar n
.Op recent | first
.Nm from
.Ar roomId
.Pp
The
.Nm grab
command is used to fetch messages from Matrix rooms.
.Pp
.Ar roomId
is of the format
.Dq ![roomname]:[homeserver] .
.Pp
.Nm matelcli grab
.Ar n
.Nm recent
.Ar roomId
fetches the
.Ar n
messages which are most recently sent to room
.Ar roomId .
.Pp
.Nm matelcli grab
.Ar n
.Nm early
.Ar roomId
fetches the
.Ar n
earliest messages of room
.Ar roomId .
.Sh MARKING EVENTS AS HAVING BEEN READ
Where
.Ar k
is a valid event identifier,
.Nm matelcli markread
.Ar k
marks the event whose event identifier is
.Ar k
as having been read.
.Sh ENTERING THE MATRIX
Using the username and password which are specified in
.Pa Config.hs ,
.Nm matelcli login
generates a new authorisation token for the user's Matrix account and
prints this authorisation token to the standard output.
.Sh SYNC
.Nm matelcli sync
.Op Ar since
.Pp
The Matrix
.Dq sync
command can be sent to the homeserver via the
.Nm matelcli
.Nm sync
command.
.Pp
If
.Ar since
is specified, then the
.Dq since
value of the
.Dq sync
request equals
.Ar since.
The
.Dq since
value is otherwise unmentioned in the
.Dq sync
request.
.Sh JOINING ROOMS
.Nm matelcli join
.Ar room
.Op Ar inviter_id token signature
.Pp
Matrix rooms are joined via the
.Nm join
command.
.Pp
If the number of arguments equals 1, then
.Nm matelcli
attempts to add the user to the room whose internal Matrix ID is
.Ar room .
.Pp
If the number of arguments equals 4, then
.Nm matelcli
attempts to add the user to the room whose internal Matrix ID is
.Ar room
such that the Matrix API query mentions the inviter's user ID
.Ar inviter_id ,
the token of the invitation
.Ar token ,
and the signature of the invitation
.Ar signature .
.Sh LEAVING ROOMS
.Nm matelcli leave
.Ar roomid
.Pp
The
.Nm leave
command is used to leave Matrix rooms.
.Pp
If command
.Nm leave Ar roomid
is entered and all goes well, then Matel's user leaves the Matrix room
whose internal ID is
.Ar roomid .
If something breaks, then a description of the breakage is output to
the standard error.
.Sh KICKING ROOM MEMBERS
.Nm matelcli kick Ar user roomid
.Pp
Assuming that Matel's user has the appropriate permissions and
everything else goes well,
.Nm matelcli kick Ar user roomid
kicks the user whose Matrix ID is
.Ar user
from the Matrix room whose internal Matrix ID is
.Ar roomid .
.Pp
If some weird error is encountered, then a description of this error is
written to the standard output.
.Sh CREATING ROOMS
.Nm matelcli createroom
.Ar roomname topic permission
creates a Matrix room whose display name and topic are
.Ar roomname
and
.Ar topic ,
respectively.  If
.Ar permission
equals
.Dq private ,
then a private room is created.  If
.Ar permission
equals
.Dq public ,
then a public room is created.  If
.Ar permission
equals some other thing, then the homeserver probably responds with
whinging.
.Pp
If the desired room is actually created, then the internal Matrix ID of
the created room is written to the standard output.
.Pp
If something breaks, then a description of the breakage is written to
the standard error.
.Sh BANNING USERS
.Nm matelcli ban
.Ar username
.Ar roomid
.Ar reason
bans the user whose username is
.Ar username
from the Matrix room whose room ID is
.Ar roomid ,
justifying this action with explanation
.Ar reason Ns ...
if the user which attempts to run this command has the appropriate
privileges.
.Sh UN-BANNING USERS
.Nm matelcli unban
.Ar username
.Ar roomid
un-bans the user whose username is
.Ar username
from the Matrix room whose room ID is
.Ar roomid Ns ...
if the user which attempts to un-ban the user has the appropriate
privileges.
.Sh UPLOADING FILES
.Nm matelcli upload
.Ar filename
uploads the file which is read from the standard input to the homeserver
of the user of
.Nm matelcli ,
claiming that the filename of the uploaded file is
.Ar filename .
.Pp
The content of the file is cheesily read from the standard input because
giving
.Nm matelcli
direct access to the file implies being unable to use
.Xr unveil 2
to the maximum extent.
.Pp
Luckily, the cheesiness can be partially
decreased if for all files
.Va k ,
.Va k
is uploaded using the following command:
.Pp
.Dl matelcli upload k < k
.Pp
The user should note that files which are uploaded via the
.Nm upload
command are uploaded to the homeserver
.Em unencrypted .
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss Sending a Text-Based Message
The following command sends a message whose body is
.Dq yo, you suck
to the Matrix room whose internal Matrix ID is
.Sy !junkers:matrix.org :
.Pp
.Dl  echo -n 'yo, you suck' | matelcli send text !junkers:matrix.org
.Sh IMPROVING THE DISPLAY OF STUFF
The default
.Dq Show
instances which are used to print stuff are by and large a bit cheesy;
however, re-writing these things should be reasonably easy for
experienced Haskellers.  But inexperienced Haskellers need not worry;
within reason, VARIK is willing to write custom
.Dq Show
instances for the users of Matel.  But men who wish to request custom
.Dq Show
instances should ensure that the desired
.Dq Show
instance does not already exist.
.Sh BUG REPORTS
Bug reports should be sent to the maintainer or posted to
.Lk http://github.com/varikvalefor/matel/issues Matel's issue page .
