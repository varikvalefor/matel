Matel is an incomplete Haskell-based Matrix client.

## Goals
The goals of the development of Matel are as follows:
* Matel fully supports Matrix's text-based communication.
* Matel is damn fast.
* Matel's source code is readable.
* Matel runs perfectly on the BSDs, the Linux distros, and Microsoft Windows.
* The number of Matel's dependencies is minimised.

## Pronunciation
The official pronunciations of "Matel" include \/məˈtɛl\/, which is VARIK's preferred pronunciation, and \/meɪˌtəl\/.

## Getting Started
### Configuration
